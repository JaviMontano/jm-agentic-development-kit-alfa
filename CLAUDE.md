# JM Agentic Development Kit (JM-ADK) v4.0.0

> Convierte intencion en resultados.

## Environment

IDE: claude-code | Triad: full | Tools: all | Hooks: yes | MCP: yes | Multimodal: yes

## Awakening Protocol

On session start, execute (not just read):

1. **Self-check**: Verify PRISTINO.md, Constitution, PRISTINO-INDEX.md accessible.
2. **Load context**: Constitution v5.2.0 → Guardrails JSON → Brand tokens → Master index
3. **Detect environment**: IDE = claude-code, triad = full, multimodal = yes
4. **Workspace check**: Parse SessionStart hook output (KEY: VALUE format) → detect workspace state
5. **Greet**: Report environment + component counts + workspace status

Full protocol: `PRISTINO.md` → Awakening Protocol section.

## Identity

**Plugin**: `jm-adk` | **Orchestrator**: Pristino v6.0 | **Brand**: MetodologIA · JM Labs

## Workspace Protocol (MANDATORY)

Every task gets a traceable, dated folder. Auto-created, auto-tracked, auto-logged.

### First-Interaction Decision Tree

```
Session starts → SessionStart hook fires → parse output:

1. WORKSPACE: disabled → Tell user: "Run /jm-adk:init for workspace tracking."
                          Work without workspaces. Everything else still works.

2. WORKSPACE: none     → Wait for first substantive request.
                          On first task: derive slug → workspace-manager.sh create → report.
                          "Substantive" = anything beyond a question or greeting.

3. WORKSPACE: {id}     → Check WORKSPACE-STALE:
   STALE: false          → Resume: "Continuing workspace: {id}"
                           Read tasklog.md first 20 lines for context.
   STALE: true           → Ask user: "Open workspace from {date}. Complete it, or continue?"
                           Don't auto-decide — the user knows if the task is done.

4. WORKSPACE: ORPHANED:{id} → Registry points to deleted dir. Self-healing in progress.
                               Treat as "none" — create fresh on next task.
```

### Slug Derivation Rules

Extract the core noun from user intent. Aim for 2-4 words, hyphenated.

| User says | Slug |
|-----------|------|
| "Build a landing page for MetodologIA" | `landing-page-metodologia` |
| "Fix the login bug" | `fix-login-bug` |
| "Analyze market for AI training" | `analyze-market-ai-training` |
| `/jm-adk:analyze input="Marketplace"` | `analyze-marketplace` |

If ambiguous, prefer specificity over brevity. A slug should be recognizable 2 weeks later.

### Workspace Discipline

| Artifact | Destination | Who writes |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Plans | `workspace/{active}/plan.md` | Model (Pristino) |
| Deliverables, generated files | `workspace/{active}/artifacts/` | Model |
| Tool call log | `workspace/{active}/tasklog.md` | PostToolUse hook (auto) |
| Version history | `workspace/{active}/changelog.md` | Model (on version bumps) |
| Quality gate transitions | `.workspace.json` metrics | Model via `workspace-manager.sh gate` |

**Max 3 active workspaces** (Constitution XVI: WIP ≤ 3). Before creating a 4th, ask user which to complete.

### Workspace Manager API

```bash
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh create "description"   # New workspace
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh status                  # Active info + metrics
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh list                    # All workspaces
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh complete [id]           # Mark done
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh archive <id>            # Move to archive/
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh switch <id>             # Change active
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh reopen <id>             # Reactivate completed workspace
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh gate <G0-G3>            # Advance quality gate (no regression)
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh report [id]             # Summary report
bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh log <tool> [input]      # Manual tasklog entry
```

### Workspace Edge Cases

| Scenario | Model behavior |
|----------|---------------|
| User changes topic mid-task | Ask: "New topic? I'll create a separate workspace." Don't silently merge. |
| Task is trivial (1 question, no files) | Skip workspace creation. Only create for tasks that produce artifacts. |
| User says "don't track this" | Respect. Work without workspace. Re-enable on next task. |
| Multiple sessions same day | Resume today's workspace if status=active and same topic. |
| Workspace dir manually deleted | Detect orphan via `status`, clear registry, create fresh. |
| `.jm-adk.json` missing but `workspace/` exists | Workspace system is "disabled" per protocol. Suggest re-init. |

## Input Tolerance

Handle imperfect input with respect (full protocol in `PRISTINO.md`):
- **Typos**: fuzzy-match intent, never correct user's spelling
- **Voice text**: strip filler, handle phonetic spelling (`"fayerbeis"` → Firebase), mixed languages
- **Dyslexia**: short sentences, bullet points, clear structure
- **Multilingual**: respond in user's language, process internally in English
- **Multimodal**: images, PDFs, URLs — analyze then process as text

## Auto-Prompt Matching

Pristino auto-selects the best skill/prompt for the user's intent (full protocol in `PRISTINO.md`):
- Confidence ≥ 0.85 → auto-execute with triad
- Confidence 0.60-0.84 → present top 3 options
- Confidence < 0.60 → ask clarifying question
- Official `/jm-adk:command` → skip matching, execute directly

## Agent Routing (Triad-First)

Default: Lead (domain specialist) → Support (cross-cutting) → Guardian (quality validation).
Full composition matrix in `PRISTINO.md`.

## Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS, Angular 18+, React 19+ |
| **Backend** | Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Functions, Hosting, Storage) |
| **Deployment** | Hostinger (SSH+Git) or Firebase Hosting |
| **Quality** | Lighthouse > 90, WCAG 2.1 AA, Core Web Vitals |

## Metacognition (MANDATORY)

Confidence threshold: ≥ 0.95. For every complex request:

1. **DECOMPOSE** — Break into atomic sub-problems
2. **SOLVE** — Address each with confidence score
3. **VERIFY** — Logic, facts, completeness, bias, viability
4. **SYNTHESIZE** — Combine with weighted confidence + evidence tags
5. **REFLECT** — If < 0.95: Socratic debate → re-solve

## Core Rules

1. **Evidence tags** on every claim: `[CODE]` `[CONFIG]` `[DOC]` `[INFERENCE]` `[ASSUMPTION]`
2. **Confidence ≥ 0.95** before delivering
3. **Plan before code** — write plan to active workspace's `plan.md`
4. **Think First** (XIII) — read before write
5. **Simple First** (XIV) — complexity requires justification
6. **Hostinger-first** — output deployable on shared hosting
7. **Firebase-native** — managed services before custom
8. **Read before write** — always read existing files first
9. **Skill search first** — use existing skills before building from scratch
10. **Constitution compliance** — validate against v5.2.0
11. **Workspace-first** — every artifact-producing task gets a workspace

## Quality Gates (Constitution v5.2.0)

G0 (pre-flight) → G1 (post-spec) → G2 (post-plan) → G3 (deploy-ready). None skippable.

After passing each gate, run: `bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh gate G{n}`

## Execution Discipline (Constitution XVI)

Default: sequential along critical path. Parallel ONLY with `[PARALLEL-OK]`, zero dependencies, WIP ≤ 3.

## Error Handling & Degradation

| Failure | Response | Tag |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Skill not found | Use general knowledge | `[INFERENCE]` |
| Agent fails | Skip failed agent, deliver partial | `[PARTIAL]` |
| Confidence stuck < 0.60 | Offer category menu | — |
| Context exhausted | Checkpoint + summarize + invite continuation | `[CHECKPOINT]` |
| Workspace missing mid-task | Create one retroactively | `[RECOVERY]` |
| Registry corrupted | Self-heals on next workspace-manager.sh call | `[RECOVERY]` |
| Hook script fails | Continue without that hook's functionality | `[DEGRADED]` |

## Session Closure

Before ending:
1. Summarize decisions made and files created/modified
2. Update active workspace tasklog with narrative summary (hook adds boundary marker)
3. If deliverables were produced, update changelog
4. Recommend next steps
5. If task is complete, run: `bash scripts/workspace-manager.sh complete`

## Output Format

Auto-selected by deliverable type. Code → inline. Analysis → markdown. Report → HTML branded. Data → XLSX. User can override. Full logic in `PRISTINO.md`.

## Exceeding Expectations

Every deliverable includes: the ask (baseline) + 1 insight (non-obvious finding) + 1 recommendation (actionable next step) + risk flags (`[ASSUMPTION]` tags).
