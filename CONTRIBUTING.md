## Contribution Types

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md`
2. Follow the MOAT pattern (see any existing skill for reference):
   - Frontmatter: `name`, `author`, `version`, `description`, `allowed-tools`
   - Sections: TL;DR, Procedure (Discover/Analyze/Execute/Validate), Quality Criteria, Anti-Patterns, Related Skills
3. Run `python3 .agent/scripts/validate_skills.py` to verify structure
4. Run `python3 .agent/scripts/generate_index.py` to update the index

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `agents/your-agent-name.md`
2. Follow the agent pattern:
   - Frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`
   - Sections: Role, Skills (table), Decision Framework, Anti-Patterns, Output Standards
3. Map the agent to 3-5 relevant skills

### Adding a New Command

1. Create `commands/your-command.md`
2. Follow the command pattern:
   - Frontmatter: `description`, `user-invocable: true`
   - Sections: Purpose, Workflow, Arguments, Examples, Related Commands

### Adding a New Prompt

1. Create `prompts/{category}/NN-your-prompt.md`
2. Follow the prompt pattern:
   - Frontmatter: `name`, `category`, `description`, `agents`, `skills`
   - Sections: Context, Prompt (with `{{variables}}`), Expected Output, Variables table

### Improving Documentation

- Fix typos, improve clarity, add examples
- All docs use GitHub-Flavored Markdown
- Keep language accessible — write for developers, not just AI agents

### Reporting Bugs

Use the [Bug Report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to report issues.

## Pull Request Process

1. **One PR per concern** — Don't mix features, fixes, and docs in one PR
2. **Descriptive title** — Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
3. **Fill the PR template** — Describe what, why, and how to test
4. **Pass validation** — Skills must pass `validate_skills.py`
5. **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** — If you added new agents/skills/commands/prompts
6. **Update CHANGELOG.md** — Add entry under `[Unreleased]`

### Conventional Commit Prefixes

| Prefix | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `feat:` | New skill, agent, command, or prompt |
| `fix:` | Bug fix in existing component |
| `docs:` | Documentation changes |
| `refactor:` | Restructuring without behavior change |
| `chore:` | Build scripts, CI, tooling |
| `style:` | Formatting, whitespace |

## Style Guide

### Markdown Files

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- One sentence per line (for better diffs)
- Code blocks with language identifiers (````bash`, ````json`, etc.)
- Tables for structured data
- Mermaid diagrams for architecture visualizations

### Skill Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: kebab-case-name
author: Your Name
version: 1.0.0
description: >
  Multi-line description.
  Trigger: "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3"
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - Grep
  - Bash
---
```

### Evidence Tags

All factual claims must include evidence tags:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[CODE]` | Verified in source code |
| `[CONFIG]` | Verified in configuration |
| `[DOC]` | Verified in documentation |
| `[INFERENCE]` | Logical deduction |
| `[ASSUMPTION]` | Unverified assumption |

### Naming Conventions

| Component | Convention | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Skills | `kebab-case/SKILL.md` | `firebase-setup/SKILL.md` |
| Agents | `kebab-case.md` | `architecture-designer.md` |
| Commands | `kebab-case.md` | `scaffold-firebase.md` |
| Prompts | `NN-kebab-case.md` | `01-analyze-requirements.md` |
